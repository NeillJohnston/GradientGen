# GradientGen

Made this one evening because I wanted a better way to make cutesy colorful boxes.  
Licensed with the Unlicense, so feel free to use this code in any way you please.

## Help

There are 4 color inputs: a large background color, and three gradient colors.  
Size changes the size of the square canvas (in pixels).  
Rot changes the offset rotation of the gradient colors.  
Res changes the resolution of the drawn pixels, lower res = higher pixel density*.  
If you want to save the image, point to the canvas > right-click > save image as.

\*This isn't what res means, but I don't care. I needed a three-letter word to make the page look nice.
